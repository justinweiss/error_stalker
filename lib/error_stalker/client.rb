# The error_stalker client enables you to log exception data to a

# method you want to use out of this class, although for those who
# like block syntax, this class also provides a +report_exceptions+
# method that reports all exceptions raised inside a block.

  #   be a string, but you won't get information like the backtrace if
  #   you don't pass an actual exception subclass.
